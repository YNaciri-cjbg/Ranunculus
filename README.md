# Ranunculus
Data and R-program to separate three Ranunculus species unsing a Linear Discriminant Aanalysis (LDA)
Two datasets are provided: the first one with 77 individuals assigned to R. tricophyllus, R. peltatus and R. penicillatus (RanunculusBases2020.txt).
The second one contains 10 individuals that were difficlt to assign to one of those species (RanunculusTest2020.txt).
The R program gives a routine to compute a Linear discriminant analysis of the first dataset and to assign a priori the unclear individuals using the results 
on the first dataset.
